2. Check Buffer Hit ratio
SELECT counter_name as CounterName, (a.cntr_value * 1.0 / b.cntr_value) * 100.0 as BufferCacheHitRatio FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters  
a JOIN  (SELECT cntr_value,OBJECT_NAME FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters WHERE 
counter_name = 'Buffer cache hit ratio base' AND OBJECT_NAME LIKE '%Buffer Manager%') 
b ON  a.OBJECT_NAME = b.OBJECT_NAME WHERE a.counter_name =
 'Buffer cache hit ratio' AND a.OBJECT_NAME LIKE '%Buffer Manager%'

3. Page life expectancy

SELECT [object_name],
[counter_name],
[cntr_value] FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE [object_name] LIKE '%Manager%'
AND [counter_name] = 'Page life expectancy'


4. Performance compter

select * from sys.dm_os_performance_counters
